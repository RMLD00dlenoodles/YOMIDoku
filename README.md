# Welcome to the [YOMIDoku](https://rmld00dlenoodles.github.io/YOMIDoku) github page.

This is the one stop site for all your YOMI Hustle modding needs. 

Currently YOMIDoku only offers documentation, however the site will house a well-documented example character, documentation on .tscn files, plus a list of best practices and detailed example code for use in your personal mod.

## Want to contribute?

Thats great! Navigate over to the [YOMIDoku contribution tutorial page](https://rmld00dlenoodles.github.io/YOMIDoku/miscellaneous/contribution) in order to get started. Alternatively, strike up a conversation with the [site owner](https://rmld00dlenoodles.github.io/YOMIDoku/about/#contact-information).

Happy hustling!
